### What is Version Control / Revision Control / Source Control?

- management of changes made to documents
- is not limited to tracking changes or versions, it can contain a bunch of information about who made those changes, often called *blame* (can blame bugs on someone)
- may contain information about when the change was made and what the actual changes were, down to every single line in a particular document

### Why is Version Control So Important?

1. keeping track of changes
2. ability to go back to a previous working version
3. easily adding someone's work

### Where Can I Use Git Version Control?

- with any code file - JS, CSS, Java, Python, etc.
- any document, like a PDF file
- no limit on what I can track with Git - any type of file

### Why to Use Version Control? How Do Dev Teams Use Version Control?

The reason why a good branch structure is so important is because it enables me to have a working version of my project. It should not matter if I have just implemented a new feature and may have broken some things, because always somewhere I have a working version of my project. Eg., I deploy to my users and go back to my working version to continue working from there.

### How to Add New Code?

Essentially, I have a __master__ branch, which is created by default when I initialize my Git repository. It's the __master__ branch where I keep my _working version_. I rarely make any commits into this __master__ branch.

Instead, I have a __test__ branch. It is this branch, from which I send commits to the __master__, but only after I have tested that new version. In the __test__ branch I must be entirely sure that this version is working, then I send it to the __master__.

Even before the __test__ branc, I hav the __dev__ branch where I make most of the direct commits. I can create a new feature and add it inside of the __dev__ branch. Eventually, when it's ready to be tested, I send it to the __test__ branch.

The QA/SDET team uses this __test__ branch to test the feature. Once testers make sure that it works, they send it to the __master__.

This is an ideal main structure of my branches.
