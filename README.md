### What is Version Control / Revision Control / Source Control?

- management of changes made to documents
- is not limited to tracking changes or versions, it can contain a bunch of information about who made those changes, often called *blame* (can blame bugs on someone)
- may contain information about when the change was made and what the actual changes were, down to every single line in a particular document

### Why is Version Control So Important?

1. keeping track of changes
2. ability to go back to a previous working version
3. easily adding someone's work

### Where Can I Use Git Version Control?

- with any code file - JS, CSS, Java, Python, etc.
- any document, like a PDF file
- no limit on what I can track with Git - any type of file
