### What is Version Control / Revision Control / Source Control?

- management of changes made to documents
- is not limited to tracking changes or versions, it can contain a bunch of information about who made those changes, often called *blame* (can blame bugs on someone)
- may contain information about when the change was made and what the actual changes were, down to every single line in a particular document

### Why is Version Control So Important?

1. keeping track of changes
2. ability to go back to a previous working version
3. easily adding someone's work

### Where Can I Use Git Version Control?

- with any code file - JS, CSS, Java, Python, etc.
- any document, like a PDF file
- no limit on what I can track with Git - any type of file

### Why to Use Version Control? How Do Dev Teams Use Version Control?

The reason why a good branch structure is so important is because it enables me to have a working version of my project. It should not matter if I have just implemented a new feature and may have broken some things, because always somewhere I have a working version of my project. Eg., I deploy to my users and go back to my working version to continue working from there.

### How to Add New Code?

Essentially, I have a __master__ branch, which is created by default when I initialize my Git repository. It's the __master__ branch where I keep my _working version_. I rarely make any commits into this __master__ branch.

Instead, I have a __test__ branch. It is this branch, from which I send commits to the __master__, but only after I have tested that new version. In the __test__ branch I must be entirely sure that this version is working, then I send it to the __master__.

Even before the __test__ branc, I have the __dev__ branch where I make most of the direct commits. I can create a new feature and add it inside of the __dev__ branch. Eventually, when it's ready tho be tested, I send it to the __test__ branch.

The QA/SDET team uses this __test__ branch to test the feature. Once testers make sure that it works, they send it to the __master__.

This is an ideal main structure of my branches.

The __dev__ branch is where most of the interesting things happen, where I add new features.

It may not be the case that I add those features directly to the __dev__ branch. But I may also create branches that eventually merge into the __dev__ branch (eg., feature-1, feature-2, etc.).
In some scenarios, this may happen in the __test__ branch instead, although it's less commmon. Eg., to quickly fix a bug or add a feature, after I've already merged from the __dev__ branch to the __test__ branch.
A more common scenario is when I merge directly from the __dev__ branch into the __test__ branch, once I have added some features to the __dev__ branch and ready for them to be tested.

### What's the Difference between git and GitHub?

__git__ is a local VCS software that enables developers to save snapshots of their projects over time. Itâ€™s generally best for individual use. 

__GitHub__ is a web-based platform that incorporates gitâ€™s version control features so they can be used collaboratively.
